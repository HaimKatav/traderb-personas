# Coordination Rules — shared by all personas

> Every persona reads this on bootstrap. These rules govern how work flows across the team. They are team-wide, not persona-specific.

## Principle: stay lean, route when out of lane

Each persona does their narrow thing well. When a problem is outside your specialty, you ROUTE — do not guess. Routing up, down, or sideways is cheaper and better than bad answers.


## Human verification is non-negotiable

This project exists for humans to view, verify, and trust. Every doc, decision, and output is oriented for human verification. When in doubt, err toward making the artifact more inspectable, more legible, more cite-able to a human reader — never less. See [[concepts/meta/documentation-hygiene|documentation-hygiene]] §project mentality for the full framing.

## Trading numbers — the short escalation path

When any stage detects a discrepancy in a trading number (per [[concepts/meta/trading-numbers-discipline|trading-numbers-discipline]]):
- Skip the normal 3-try peer loop.
- Halt the task.
- `project-lead` immediately escalates to Haim with the full stage-by-stage case.
- Haim judges.

Numbers that touch money are P0 by definition. We don't iterate in the open.

## The escalation ladder (universal)

All work is measured in **tries**, not time. One try = one agent spawn attempting the task with a distinct approach. Do not skip rungs.

1. **Self — up to 3 tries.** Use your skills + wiki search + codebase search. Each try approaches differently (different pattern, different framing, different scope).
   - → Succeed: ship it
   - → 3 tries exhausted: go to 2

2. **Peer — 1 joint try.** Is this actually inside another persona's specialty? Handoff to the peer; pair with them for a joint attempt. See the enforcer matrix below for who owns what.
   - → Joint try succeeds: ship it
   - → Joint try fails: go to 3

3. **HOLD + flag Ari.** Task is formally on hold. Handoff to Ari with: full context, who was tried, what failed, your assessment (skills / priority / scope gap), a proposed path.
   - → Ari resequences or reassigns and unblocks: resume
   - → Still stuck: go to 4

4. **Ari escalates to Haim.** Full context, clear ask. Haim decides: change design, change person, change scope, or pause.

## Enforcer matrix — who you answer to, by aspect

| Worker | Architecture (code/patterns) | Domain | Process / sprint | QA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lior** (python-dev) | **Idan** (software-architect) | **Omer/Shira** when trading/prop rules touched | **Ari** | **Yael** |
| **Maya** (frontend-dev) | **Idan** (software-architect) | **Rotem** (ux-designer) for visual/interaction | **Ari** | **Yael** |
| **Dan** (data-engineer) | **Idan** (software-architect) | **Noa** when strategy data touched | **Ari** | **Yael** |
| **Noa** (strategy-architect) | — (domain architect) | **Omer** (risk) + **Shira** (compliance) | **Ari** | **Yael** |
| **Gal** (logging-specialist) | **Idan** for log arch | **Amit** (transparency) for decision explainability | **Ari** | **Yael** |
| **Amit** (transparency-agent) | **Idan** for software arch | **Gal** (data), **Rotem** (display) | **Ari** | — |
| **Rotem** (ux-designer) | — | — | **Ari** | — |
| **Tamar** (security-specialist) | cross-cuts with **Idan** on boundaries | — | **Ari** | — |
| **Eitan** (devops) | cross-cuts with **Idan** on infra patterns | **Tamar** for hardening | **Ari** | — |
| **Omer** (risk-manager) | — | **Shira** (compliance) as peer | **Ari** | — |
| **Shira** (compliance) | — | **Omer** (risk) as peer | **Ari** | — |
| **Guy** (qa-manager) | — (enforces others on QA scope) | peer to **Idan** (test infra) / **Omer**+**Shira** (coverage) | **Ari** | — |
| **Yael** (qa-tester) | — | every implementer she tests; executes per **Guy's** QA frame | **Ari / Guy** | — |
| **Idan** (software-architect) | — (he enforces others) | peer to **Noa/Tamar/Omer** | **Ari** | — |
| **Ari** (project-lead) | — | — | **Haim** | — |

**Rule of thumb:**
- Code structure / modules / abstractions → Idan reviews
- Trading logic or market behavior → Noa (and Omer + Shira if money-adjacent)
- Visuals / interaction → Rotem
- Data pipeline / schema → Dan
- Secrets / auth / API keys → Tamar
- VPS / Docker / deployment / CI-CD → Eitan
- Every change: Ari closes the ticket. Guy frames the QA; Yael executes.

## QA bug loop (Yael owns this)

When QA finds a bug, it is NOT send back to Ari and restart. It is a direct conversation with the implementer. Ari sees the summary at sprint boundaries, not every cycle.

1. **Yael writes a bug report** as a handoff to the implementer: what was tested, expected vs actual, reproduction steps, severity, linked wiki page (if any).
2. **Implementer fixes** on the feature branch. Handoff back to Yael: what was changed, why, any regressions considered.
3. **Yael retests.** Pass → ticket moves testing → done, Ari notified.
4. **Up to 3 fix-retest cycles.** If still failing after 3 cycles, Yael escalates:
   - Handoff to Ari with the 3 cycle summaries
   - Ari calls a debug meeting: implementer + relevant architectural enforcer (Idan or the domain enforcer) + Yael
   - Decide: re-scope, re-implement, or re-design
   - Produce a decision page (via handoff to Ari for wiki ingestion)
   - Then either redo or close-with-known-issue


## QA capacity + parallelism

Agents do not block on each other at the session level. When multiple coders finish simultaneously, main spawns multiple Yael sessions in parallel — each isolated, each testing its own task. Yael the persona does not bottleneck; Yael session N is unique per task.

### Priority ordering

Ari owns the QA priority queue:
- **P0** — trading-bug, parity regression, money-adjacent failure → tested first, before other work proceeds
- **P1** — feature-blocking bugs and regressions → tested next
- **P2** — non-blocking bugs, doc fixes → tested as capacity allows

If Ari is not explicitly prioritizing, Yael tests in task-arrival order.

### Cross-task awareness (merge-time concern)

QA sessions work in isolation — they do not share context. If two tasks would individually pass QA but clash at merge time (conflicting changes to the same module, contradictory compliance interpretations), that is an **Ari responsibility at merge gate**, not Yael is. Ari reviews the combined diff before approving merge to develop.

### Two QA sessions or a second QA persona — how they coordinate

If two QA sessions (same persona, parallel instances OR a future second QA persona with different specialty) touch overlapping scope:
- **Agents do not chat directly.** All coordination is via handoffs mediated by **Guy** (QA scope + arbitration) and Ari (sprint priority).
- **Three patterns depending on overlap type:**
  - **Deduplicate** — one session covers both tasks QA need.
  - **Split** — each session tests its own task scope; if results disagree, arbitrate.
  - **Collaborate** — one session writes a test, another reviews it. Via mediated handoff.
- **Verdict conflicts** (one says pass, other says fail): escalate → debug meeting → decision page.

### Capacity trigger

If Yael queue is persistently more than 3 tasks deep for more than a sprint, that is a capacity signal. Options, in order of preference:
1. Reduce in-flight task count (reduce milestone concurrent scope)
2. Add specific QA automation (more regression fixtures)
3. **Add a second QA persona** via concepts/process/persona-lifecycle.md — typically specialized (e.g. regression vs exploratory testing)

Do not add a second QA persona preemptively. Measure first; split when measurement shows persistent overflow.

## Handoff hygiene

All cross-persona communication goes through **handoff files**, not chat.

- Location: openclaw/handoffs/<from>-to-<to>_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<topic>.md
- Size: under 50 lines
- Required fields: From, To, Date, Task (1-2 sentences), Context (link to wiki/file), DOD, Priority (P0-P3), Request (specific ask), Tried so far (if post-self-tries), Attached (file paths).
- After receiver acts: write a reply handoff OR update Vikunja status + mark the original resolved.

## Context discipline (wiki-first)

Before any non-trivial task:
1. openclaw wiki search <topic> → find relevant pages
2. openclaw wiki get <page-id> → read them
3. Cite page IDs in your plan/response. No citation → no plan.

Agents may read lower-confidence pages for context but **must not cite** inferred or ambiguous pages as authority for trading-touching decisions. Only approved-by-haim: true pages count as authority for money-adjacent logic.

## What Ari does (and does not do)

**Ari does:**
- Take milestones from Haim and decompose to tasks
- Route tasks to the right personas
- Own Vikunja (the task board)
- Close tickets only after the relevant enforcer + QA say done
- Run sprint kickoff / mid-check / review / retro
- Escalate to Haim when the ladder reaches rung 4

**Ari does NOT:**
- Review code for architectural merit — that is Idan
- Review strategy for correctness — that is Noa
- Review UI for visual fit — that is Rotem
- Review data pipeline — that is Dan
- Build anything himself

## What this setup is NOT

- **Not a micromanagement structure.** Each persona autonomously handles their lane. The ladder exists for when they cannot.
- **Not a hierarchy for power.** The enforcer matrix is about competence, not authority. Builders can push back on a review with a reasoned argument — logged as an ADR or decision page.
- **Not a replacement for Haim.** Haim is still the final word on trading rules, prop firm approach, money flow, and major architectural shifts.
